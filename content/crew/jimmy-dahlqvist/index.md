With extensive experience across AWS and Cloud, I’ve worked with leading companies like Sony, Infor, Ikea, and AssaAbloy, helping them unlock the full potential of cloud technologies.

Passionate about IoT and serverless architectures, I take a “serverless-first” approach to software development, gradually evolving systems into container-based services as needed. I’m always looking for innovative ways to leverage cloud technologies to create efficient, cost-effective solutions.

As a public speaker and blogger, I love sharing knowledge and inspiring others to succeed in the cloud space. Whether it’s through talks, blog posts, or open-source contributions, I strive to empower others with the best practices I’ve learned over the years.

What sets me apart is my commitment to excellence and my belief that the best solutions are built on solid foundations. I’m confident, curious, and always go the extra mile—not just to ensure success, but to push the boundaries of what’s possible. I thrive in collaborative environments, bringing a practical and organised approach to every task, while continuously striving to deliver impactful results.

In my personal life, I’m a BBQ enthusiast and have connected my smoker using IoT and AWS to monitor and control it remotely—blending my love for tech with some delicious BBQ!
