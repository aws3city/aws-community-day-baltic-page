I am a full-stack developer and developer relations with a solid communication and people skills background. 
My knowledge includes Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, and React, with additional experience with Vue.js, Node.js, React Native, GraphQL, APIs, and AWS serverless services such as AWS Lambdas and DynamoDB. I am also a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner and started an exciting journey of self-taught Python.

Additionally, I'm an active and passionate community member committed to supporting growth and enablement. I teach AI Fundamentals in Malmö as a volunteer at ReDI School, a non-profit focused on digital empowerment for women with migrant and refugee backgrounds, and work as a Social Media Specialist for Women In Tech Sweden.

I'm an AWS User Group Skåne co-organizer, AWS Community Builder, and AWS User Group Leader. I manage a WhatsApp community created to foster Women In Tech in the AWS ecosystem. 
While living in New Zealand, I founded and organized the Auckland AWS Tools and Programming meetup and co-organized for four years the Full-Stack Engineering - Auckland and Cloud Native & Platform Engineering Auckland.

With a Bachelor's degree in Communication and experience in various areas, such as journalism, public relations, management, and customer service, I bring a multifaceted background to the table.
This diverse skill set allows me to effectively support teams across various areas and tasks and has made me a collaborative team player with a flexible and resilient mindset. I have also been acknowledged for my ability to work effectively within teams to achieve business outcomes.

Having a strong passion for learning and a love for everything I do are some skills I bring to the technology field.
