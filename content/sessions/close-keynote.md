What happens when AI makes code writing the easiest part of development? The rise of Generative AI has transformed software development, making rapid prototyping more accessible than ever. This keynote examines the evolving role of developers as AI reshapes traditional coding practices. The presentation cuts through both hype and fear to explore what truly matters in modern software development. Learn why moving from intuition-based 'vibe coding' to structured engineering approaches becomes more crucial with AI assistance. The session demonstrates how specification-driven development and engineering principles create the foundation for successful AI collaboration.
