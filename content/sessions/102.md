An epic adventure requires proper preparation, whether in a fantastical RPG world or in the realm of AWS cloud-based projects. To succeed, you must assemble a team, plan your journey, and choose the right equipment – because just as one sword cannot defeat every enemy, one set of AWS services does not fit every project.

In this session, we will embark on a journey that compares building projects in AWS to a classic RPG game. We’ll explore the principles of the Well-Architected Framework, which, much like a party guide, helps you make the right architectural decisions. We’ll discuss how to select AWS services that meet the specific challenges of your project and how to prepare for unexpected obstacles along the way.

Join this session to discover how to build an infrastructure that is not only efficient and secure but also ready for the challenges ahead – because in AWS, just like in RPGs, victory depends on a solid plan, teamwork, and thoughtful selection of tools.
