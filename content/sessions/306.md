AWS Strands Agents is fresh out of the lab, a brand-new framework for building and orchestrating intelligent agents. In this session, we’ll explore how to tame that new power with a familiar toolset: object-oriented design. You’ll learn how to break agents into clean, testable components, keep their state organized, and build systems that are easy to extend as the technology evolves. We’ll look at practical examples, pitfalls to avoid, and why combining OOP patterns with this bleeding-edge AWS SDK can give you a serious head start in building the next generation of agent-driven applications.
