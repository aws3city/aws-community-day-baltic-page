ip.labs is the world's leading white label e-commerce software imaging company and processes millions of images every day. The workflows of our users consist of designing, saving, loading, ordering and delivering to the printing facilities the photo products like prints, photobooks, calendars, gift products among others. In this talk we'll explore our motivation and architecture behind the reimplementation of our image storage solution based on AWS Serverless services like API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, EventBridge, Kinesis and others. We'll especially dive deeper into the parts using event-driven communication and explore patterns like storage-first, fan out, change log and cross-account logging among others and explain our architectural decisions.
