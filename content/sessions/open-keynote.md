This session explores the Model Context Protocol (MCP) from basic concepts to practical applications. We'll start with generative AI fundamentals and quickly move to how MCP enhances AI systems through structured context handling.

We'll examine MCP's technical architecture and how it improves conversations with AI by enabling RAG systems and agent workflows. The presentation breaks down MCP's key components and integration points for developers looking to implement this technology.

The talk concludes with live demonstrations of MCP in action: knowledge retrieval using Amazon Bedrock, Kubernetes troubleshooting automation, and Terraform code generation. Attendees will learn how to leverage MCP to build more capable AI applications across various technical domains.
