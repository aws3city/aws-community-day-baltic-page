DynamoDB powers everything from indie apps to Amazon-scale workloads, yet many teams barely scratch the surface of what it can do. In this session we'll strip away the mystique, explore the service's key building blocks, and see how they work together in practice. Then we'll tackle the (in)famous single-table design - why it's worth considering, where it shines, and where it might not. You'll leave with a clear mental model, practical design guidance, and the confidence to build a DynamoDB schema that stays fast, cost-aware, and ready for whatever your roadmap throws at it.
