Explore a clear path from your first AI agent to production multi-agent systems. We start with what an agent is and why multi-agent designs are popular. Then we outline how to build a local agent on your laptop using the open-source Strands framework and extend it to multi-agent collaboration. Finally, we map the production blueprint on AWS with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore—covering runtime choices, scaling, shared memory, security, and observability. You’ll leave with step-by-step guidance, code references, and an at-home checklist to replicate and evolve from simple prototypes to enterprise-ready systems.
