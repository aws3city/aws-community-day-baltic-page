As software developers, we’re all guilty of having at least a few unfinished side projects collecting dust on our GitHub repositories. For me, blogging was one of those ideas that stayed on my to-do list for ages until AWS Amplify changed the game.
In this session, I’ll share how I used AWS Amplify to stop procrastinating and finally build a platform to share content focused on helping women and tech beginners navigate their tech journeys. We’ll explore how Amplify makes it easy to deploy frontend apps, add storage, connect to real-time data sources, and scale seamlessly. The best part? All of that without needing deep cloud expertise.
Join me as I walk through my journey from idea to execution with AWS Amplify and learn how you can do the same to bring your projects to life, breaking free from procrastination.

Key Takeaways:
