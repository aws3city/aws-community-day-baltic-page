In this hands-on workshop you will learn how to build agentic applications on AWS using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the AWS Strands SDK. We will cover the core concepts, how to define tools and capabilities, how to ground agents in enterprise knowledge, and how to orchestrate complex tasks securely. You will leave with practical examples you can adapt to your own use cases.
