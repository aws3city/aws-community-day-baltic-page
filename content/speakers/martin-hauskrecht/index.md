Currently working as a Head of Engineering at Labyrinth Labs. My main focus is building resilient and highly scalable infrastructures and cloud-native platforms in AWS and Azure using Kubernetes and/or Serverless technologies.

There Are No Magic Tricks in Cloud Cost Optimization

Cloud cost optimization isn’t about clever billing tricks, there are no shortcuts here. It’s about engineering maturity. If you’re serious about lowering your cloud spend without breaking your velocity, join this presentation. We’ll look at why savings plans and tools aren’t enough, how finance and engineering often misalign, and what high-maturity teams do differently. You’ll leave knowing what to focus on and where the real impact lies.
