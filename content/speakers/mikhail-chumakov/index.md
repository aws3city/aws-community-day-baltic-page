Over nineteen years of experience in software development and design.
I have been passionate about cloud technologies for the last nine years.
My journey with the cloud began with Azure. However, about three years later, AWS became my primary cloud provider at work. 
From the beginning, I was impressed by how cloud technologies help engineers in their work and help deliver solutions much faster and easier. 
For the last four years, my interests and work mainly focused on serverless infrastructure, containerized applications, and search. 
Besides that, I am also curious about other cloud providers, like GCP and Azure.

I'm the AWS Community Builder.

Speaker and co-organizer of the "Mambo Jambo Cloud Talks" community meetup in Prague.
