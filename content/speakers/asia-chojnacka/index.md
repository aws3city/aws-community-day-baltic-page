AWS Community Builder, cloud and serverless enthusiast. I've had the opportunity to work on projects ranging from fast-paced startups to global enterprises. I enjoy sharing knowledge with the tech community — I publish articles on Medium, create videos on YouTube channel @takecert when time allows, and share insights and highlights from tech conferences on Instagram @take.cert.
