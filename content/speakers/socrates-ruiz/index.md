I'm a computer engineer and a developer at my core, so I would rather work on hands-on tasks in the projects than making Power Point presentations. I have worked in Mexico, Spain and now Germany in Data Insights for several industries and I'm also part of the AWS Community Builders program, so I want to share the experience I have had in the cloud and data fields.
