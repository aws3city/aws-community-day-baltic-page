I'm a computer engineer and a developer at my core, so I would rather work on hands-on tasks in the projects than making Power Point presentations. I have worked in Mexico, Spain and now Germany in Data Insights for several industries and I'm also part of the AWS Community Builders program, so I want to share the experience I have had in the cloud and data fields.

Back to the network: AWS DeLorean at 88 MPH

AWS doesn't have a Flux Capacitor per se, but it relies on a key concept that, without it, we wouldn't be able to use its services at all: the network. Sometimes, I think we just grant it this and forget that it is the base, and when we give a peak to the available network services, the number of them can be overwhelming.

Some of them run in the background of other trendy services like Bedrock or are the base of core ones like EC2. That's why I want to share some lessons I wish I had known when I started working in AWS 12 years ago.

Join me in this session, where we will see a use case that required a hybrid connection between AWS and our On-Premises System, the challenges we had during the setup and debugging of our environment, and check some tips while using services like Site-to-Site and Client VPN, AWS Global Accelerator, Route 53 Resolver, PrivateLink and Redshift, Glue, Lambda VPC integration, to get our environment beyond 88 MPH.
